# LianeAPI Class Documentation

The `LianeAPI` class is designed to interact with the Liane chatbot API, providing methods for sending questions, retrieving AI information, and constructing URLs. Below is a detailed description of the methods available in the `LianeAPI` class.

For the correct `id` and `username`, check [liaspark.chatbotcommunity.ltd](https://liaspark.chatbotcommunity.ltd). If the AI is created by an unregistered user, no need to include the `username` in the constructor.
